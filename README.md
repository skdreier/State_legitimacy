01_recoding_variables.R cleans and recodes variables from the source Afrobarometer data and subsets into a new dataset (afro_courts_police.csv).

The original dataset "merged_r6_data_2016_36countries2.sav" contains the merged Afrobarometer Round 6 (2016) survey data. It is available to be downloaded at: http://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/data/round-6/merged_r6_data_2016_36countries2.sav.s
