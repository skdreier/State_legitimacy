## Recode and prepare data

The original dataset [merged_r6_data_2016_36countries2.sav](http://afrobarometer.org/sites/default/files/data/round-6/merged_r6_data_2016_36countries2.sav) contains the merged Afrobarometer Round 6 (2016) survey data. It is available to be downloaded from the [Afrobarometer website](http://afrobarometer.org).

[variable_recode.R](source/variable_recode.R) recodes variables from the source Afrobarometer data for the purposes of this analysis. This script also subsets the recoded variables into the new dataset.

## Main analysis

[main_analysis.R](source/main_analysis.R) runs the models and simulation . plots featured in the article's main analysis. The recoded, subseted used in this script, [afro_courts_police.RData](afro_courts_police.RData), can be loaded from this repository. Its object name is "data." 

[binary.R](source/ R) simulates results from the article's main binary-IV models. 

All resulting [figures](figures/) are also posted in the repository.
